    <div class="text">
       <p> West African tourism waits to be discovered and explored by travelers from around the world. This region boasts a rich tapestry of cultural diversity, historical significance, and natural beauty that remains relatively unexplored compared to other tourist destinations. </p>
        <p>West Africa is home to vibrant and diverse nations like Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Ivory Coast, each offering a unique blend of traditions, cuisine, music, and art.</p>
         <p>Visitors can immerse themselves in the enchanting rhythms of Afrobeat music in Lagos, marvel at the intricate mud architecture of Mali's Great Mosque of Djenné, or trace the footsteps of the transatlantic slave trade in Ghana's Cape Coast Castle. </p>
        <p>Beyond its cultural heritage, West Africa boasts breathtaking landscapes, from the lush rainforests of Sierra Leone to the stunning beaches along the Gulf of Guinea. However, the region's potential as a tourism hotspot remains largely underexplored, presenting a golden opportunity for sustainable growth in the travel industry.</p>

    </div>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Djenn%C3%A9" class="tour-site djene s s1" target="blank">The actual date of construction of the first mosque in Djenné is unknown, but dates as early as 1200 and as late as 1330 have been suggested. The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid-seventeenth century. The Tarikh states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque. He built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side. His immediate successor built the towers of the mosque while the following Sultan built the surrounding wall.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loango_National_Park" class="tour-site loango s s2" target="_blank">Loango National Park (French: Parc national de Loango) is a national park in western Gabon. It protects diverse coastal habitats including part of the 220-square-kilometre (85 sq mi) Iguéla Lagoon, the only significant example of a typical western African lagoon system that is protected within a national park.

            Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo Lagoons, Loango National Park spans 1,550 km2 (600 sq mi) of savanna, beach, forest, and mangroves. The naturalist Mike Fay called Loango "Africa's Last Eden," and this is where Michael "Nick" Nichols from National Geographic took his well-known pictures of surfing hippopotamuses. Both men call Loango the 'land of surfing hippos.'</a>

        </div>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gor%C3%A9e" class="tour-site goree s s3" target="_blank">Île de Gorée (French pronunciation: ​[ildəɡoʁe]; "Gorée Island"; Wolof: Beer Dun) is one of the 19 communes d'arrondissement (i.e. districts) of the city of Dakar, Senegal. It is an 18.2-hectare (45-acre) island located 2 kilometres (1.1 nmi; 1.2 mi) at sea from the main harbour of Dakar (14°40′N 17°24′W), famous as a destination for people interested in the Atlantic slave trade although its actual role in the history of the slave trade is the subject of dispute.

            Its population as of the 2013 census was 1,680 inhabitants, giving a density of 5,802 inhabitants per square kilometre (15,030/sq mi), which is only half the average density of the city of Dakar. Gorée is both the smallest and the least populated of the 19 communes d'arrondissement of Dakar.</a>

        </div>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmina_Castle" class="tour-site elmina s s4 " target="_blank">Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as Castelo de São Jorge da Mina (St. George of the Mine Castle), also known as Castelo da Mina or simply Mina (or Feitoria da Mina), in present-day Elmina, Ghana, formerly the Gold Coast. It was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, and the oldest European building in existence south of the Sahara.[1]

            First established as a trade settlement, the castle later became one of the most important stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade. The Dutch seized the fort from the Portuguese in 1637, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1596, and took over all of the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1642. </a>

        </div>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Retba" class="tour-site retba s s5">Lake Retba, also known as Lac Rose (meaning "pink lake"), lies north of the Cap Vert peninsula in Senegal, some 35 km (22 mi) north-east of the capital, Dakar, in northwest Africa. It is named for its pink waters caused by Dunaliella salina algae and is known for its high salt content, up to 40% in some areas. Its colour is usually particularly strong from late January to early March, during the dry season; however, flooding in September 2022 not only disrupted salt harvesting activities on the lake, but because it caused the lake to lose its colour, had a negative effect on tourism.

            The lake is as of 2023 under consideration by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</a>

The facility was built by the Chevron Corporation for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), as a reserved sanctuary for the rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula. The company has since provided annual funding for the management of the centre.
    To start the conservation project, three potential areas were surveyed in 1987 by NCF technical team in partnership with the defunct Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative. Thereafter, Lekki area was chosen to establish the demonstration site for the conservation project. </a>

Guinness World Records lists it as the largest church in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, Saint Peter's Basilica, upon completion. It has an area of 30,000 square metres (320,000 sq ft) and is 158 metres (518 ft) tall. However, it also includes a rectory and a villa (counted in the overall area), which are not strictly part of the church. It can accommodate 18,000 worshippers, compared to 60,000 for St. Peter's. Ordinary liturgies conducted at the basilica are usually attended by only a few hundred people. The basilica is administered by Polish Pallottines at a cost of US$1.5 million annually. </a>
